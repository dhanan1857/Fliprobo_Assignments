12. R2 shows how well terms (data points) fit a curve or line. Adjusted R2 also indicates how well terms fit a curve or line, 
but adjusts for the number of terms in a model. If you add more and more useless variables to a model, adjusted r-squared will decrease. 
If you add more useful variables, adjusted r-squared will increase.Adjusted R2 will always be less than or equal to R2.
You only need R2 when working with samples. In other words, R2 isnâ€™t necessary when you have data from an entire population.

13.a cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y. 
   This is typically expressed as a difference or distance between the predicted value and the actual value.
   The cost function (you may also see this referred to as loss or error.) 
14. SST is the maximum sum of squares of errors for the data because the minimum information of Y itself was only used for the baseline model.
    The difference between SST and SSR is remaining unexplained variability of Y after adopting the regression model, which is called as sum of 
    squares of errors (SSE)
15. The various metrics used to evaluate the results of the prediction are : Mean Squared Error(MSE) Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE). Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE)
